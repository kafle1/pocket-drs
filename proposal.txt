1 Introduction
Cricket has become one of the most data-driven and technology-assisted sports in the
world. At the international level, technologies such as Hawk-Eye, UltraEdge, and ball-
tracking systems are now deeply integrated into umpiring decisions and broadcast graph-
ics. These systems help umpires review close calls related to Leg Before Wicket (LBW),
caught behind decisions, and boundary checks. However, they require multiple high-speed
cameras, specialized lenses, dedicated servers, and trained operators, which makes them
financially and logistically out of reach for local clubs, schools, academies, and grassroots
tournaments.
Most amateur and semi-professional matches still rely entirely on a single on-field
umpire with no technological assistance. This increases the chances of wrong decisions,
leads to disputes between players and officials, and can negatively affect the competitive
fairness and enjoyment of the game. At the same time, the capabilities of consumer smart-
phones have improved significantly, with powerful CPUs and GPUs, built-in accelerators
for machine learning, high-resolution cameras, and fast local networking features.
PocketDRS is a proposed mobile application that aims to bring core functionality of
a Decision Review System onto a single smartphone, supplemented optionally by a second
phone acting as an audio capture device. The central idea is to use the phone camera
for video capture, computer vision for ball tracking and pitch calibration, and physics-
based modelling to reconstruct and predict the ball trajectory in three dimensions. This
reconstruction is then used to assist LBW decisions and edge detection, similar in spirit
to professional DRS, but implemented in a low-cost and fully offline manner.
The project focuses on single-view 3D reconstruction, meaning that all tracking and
prediction must be done from only one camera viewpoint. The pitch and stump geometry
are used as strong constraints, and the system is designed to run entirely on-device
without requiring internet access. This makes PocketDRS suitable for rural grounds and
informal tournaments where stable connectivity cannot be guaranteed.
2 Problem Statement
Commercial DRS solutions solve the ball tracking problem using multiple synchronized
cameras positioned around the ground. These systems triangulate the ball’s 3D position
from different views and feed the result into a physics engine to predict the ball’s future
path. This approach works very well but is extremely expensive, and it cannot be scaled
down to a typical local ground.
Bringing DRS-style functionality onto a single smartphone introduces three main
technical challenges:
• Monocular Depth Ambiguity: With only one camera, depth information is not
1
directly available. A point in the image could correspond to infinitely many points
along a ray in 3D space. Recovering a realistic 3D trajectory from a single view
requires using strong prior knowledge and constraints, such as the known dimensions
of the cricket pitch and the assumption that the ball moves within a vertical plane
for a given delivery angle.
• Spin Estimation without High-Speed Cameras: Professional systems often
use high frame rate cameras or specialized sensors to measure the rotation of the
ball. A typical smartphone camera running at 30 or 60 frames per second cannot
capture the seam rotation of a fast delivery cleanly. Therefore, spin cannot be
measured directly and must be inferred from the way the ball’s path curves in
space due to aerodynamic forces like the Magnus effect.
• Audio and Video Synchronization on Local Networks: For caught behind
decisions, it is critical to correlate a spike in the audio waveform (from a stump
microphone) with the exact frame where the ball passes the bat. Over a Wi-Fi
hotspot connection between two phones, network latency and jitter cause timing
differences. The system must implement a synchronization mechanism that achieves
frame-level precision without relying on internet network time servers.
The problem this project aims to solve is therefore: Can a single smartphone, possibly
supported by a second phone as a stump microphone, reconstruct a cricket ball’s 3D
trajectory accurately enough to assist LBW and edge decisions, using only on-device
computation and offline communication between devices?
3 Objectives
The main objective is to design and implement a prototype Decision Review System that
operates entirely on mobile devices and provides understandable, visual, and numerical
support for cricket umpiring decisions.
3.1 General Objective
To develop an offline, single-view, mobile-based Decision Review System for
cricket that can reconstruct and predict a ball’s trajectory, assist LBW decisions, and
support edge detection using synchronized audio and video.
3.2 Specific Objectives
• To study existing professional DRS technologies, current research on monocular 3D
reconstruction, and mobile-based tracking systems, and to identify key techniques
that can be adapted to a smartphone environment.
2
• To design and implement an AR-based pitch calibration module that uses
known pitch and stump dimensions to estimate the camera pose using a Perspective-
n-Point (PnP) approach.
• To develop a ball detection and tracking module that can identify the ball in each
video frame and produce a smoothed 2D trajectory using techniques such as back-
ground subtraction and Kalman filtering.
• To create a 3D trajectory reconstruction and prediction module that lifts
the 2D trajectory into 3D space using the calibration information and fits a physics-
based model incorporating gravity, drag, and the Magnus effect to estimate swing
and spin.
• To implement an audio-video synchronization module that uses time exchange
messages between two phones on a local Wi-Fi connection to achieve frame-accurate
alignment between stump microphone audio and camera video.
• To design a user interface that visualizes the reconstructed and predicted trajec-
tory, highlights pitching, impact, and wicket regions, and presents edge detection
information in a format that umpires and players can easily interpret.
4 Methodology
The methodology covers requirement identification, feasibility analysis, system design,
and the core algorithmic components. The development will follow an iterative approach:
start with simple, working versions of each component and gradually refine them based
on testing.
4.1 Requirement Identification
4.1.1 Study of Existing System
Existing professional systems such as Hawk-Eye typically deploy multiple synchronized
cameras around the ground, all calibrated to a common 3D coordinate system. These
systems perform stereo triangulation to compute the ball’s 3D position over time and
then pass the result into a physics engine. For this project, such hardware and infras-
tructure are not available. This project replaces the multi-camera architecture with a
single camera and replaces the large server-based processing pipeline with optimized on-
device algorithms. Instead of relying on triangulation between cameras, the system
uses camera calibration, geometric constraints, and motion models to reconstruct the ball
trajectory from a single viewpoint.

4.1.2 Literature Review
The literature related to this project can be grouped into the following themes:
• Camera Calibration and PnP: The Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem is
highly relevant, as a cricket pitch provides known 3D points (stumps, creases) whose
corresponding 2D image projections can be used to estimate camera pose.
• Monocular 3D Reconstruction and Object Tracking: Research confirms the
feasibility of reconstructing trajectories using single-camera video when strong con-
straints (fixed field dimensions and ballistic motion) are available.
• Ball Physics and the Magnus Effect: The trajectory is influenced by gravity,
aerodynamic drag, and the Magnus effect (spin-induced force). Physics models
allow approximation of the spin vector (⃗ω) from the observed curvature, bypassing
the need for high-speed cameras.
• Time Synchronization over Local Networks: Variants of the Network Time
Protocol (NTP) over local UDP communication can be adapted to achieve a com-
mon clock between two devices on a Wi-Fi hotspot with sub-millisecond precision,
essential for audio-video alignment.
4.1.3 Requirement Analysis
Functional Requirements: The system shall capture video, perform AR-based cal-
ibration, track the ball, reconstruct its 3D path, predict LBW outcome, record and
synchronize audio for edge detection, and present decision information visually.
Non-Functional Requirements: The system must work fully offline, processing time
should ideally be below 5 seconds, reconstructed trajectory accuracy must be sufficient
for practical LBW judgment, and the user interface must be simple and intuitive.
4.2 Feasibility Study
4.2.1 Technical Feasibility
The system is technically feasible using the following stack:
• Platform/UI: Flutter for cross-platform mobile development.
• Computer Vision: Integration of OpenCV through native wrappers for PnP,
tracking, and filtering.
• Physics: Lightweight implementation of the ball dynamics equation using mobile
CPU resources.
4
• Machine Learning: The use of optimized models like TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)
for ball detection ensures high performance and fully offline computation.
4.2.2 Operational Feasibility
The solution fits the amateur environment:
• Setup: A single phone mounted on a tripod, easily calibrated using AR markers
against the pitch lines.
• Usability: Simple ”record” or ”review” button presses allow umpires with basic
smartphone familiarity to operate the system.
• Audio: The optional second phone (stump mic) connects automatically via local
hotspot, minimizing setup complexity.
4.2.3 Economic Feasibility
The system is economically highly feasible as it requires **no specialized sensors or cam-
eras**. Development relies on freely available open-source software (OpenCV, TFLite,
Flutter), resulting in zero licensing costs. The core application can be widely reused,
making the cost per match negligible.
4.3 High Level Design of System
The system is divided into four main layers: calibration, tracking, physics, and presenta-
tion.

The Physics Prediction Layer uses the tracked 3D velocity and spin data to solve
the vector equation of motion, accounting for gravity, air resistance (drag), and the crucial

Magnus effect:
m⃗a= m⃗g−CD|⃗v|2ˆ
v + CM (⃗ω ×⃗v)
Here, m is mass, ⃗a is acceleration, ⃗g is gravity, CD is the drag coefficient, and CM is
the Magnus coefficient related to the spin vector ⃗ω. This calculation enables accurate
prediction of swing and spin movement.

The development will be carried out over approximately four months.

6 Expected Outcome
Upon completion, the project is expected to deliver the following outcomes:

that can record or load a video of a delivery, perform calibration, track the ball,
reconstruct its trajectory, and visualize the result.
• LBW ASSISTANCE: For suitable camera angles, the system will show whether
the ball pitched in line, whether it struck the batsman in line, and whether the pre-
dicted trajectory would hit the stumps, providing a clear LBW decision suggestion.
• EDGE DETECTION SUPPORT: When used with a second device as a stump
microphone, the system will synchronize audio and video to identify sounds that
7
coincide precisely with the ball passing the bat, helping umpires judge possible
edges.
• DOCUMENTATION AND EVALUATION: A detailed report documenting
the algorithms, design decisions, implementation details, test results, and limita-
tions.
• FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE WORK: The project will serve as a base for
enhancements such as deep learning based ball detectors or automatic bat and pad
detection.
