# Decisions log

Keep track of choices so you can defend them in the viva.

## Pending
- Target platform (Android-only vs cross-platform).
- Calibration approach (markers vs tap-based).
- Tracking approach (classical CV vs TFLite detector).
- 3D reconstruction method (plane constraint vs optimization).

## Principle
Prefer methods that are:
- testable with short clips
- robust under real lighting
- explainable in the report
- achievable within the semester
